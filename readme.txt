A Simple Multiple Note System for Wordpress

== Description ==

Do you tend to keep all of your notes on a large collection of bits of paper? Would you rather keep them all easily accessable on your Wordpress site, so they are all there to your fingers? Then NinjaNOtes is for you.

It lets you have as many sperate notepads as you want. It's a great way to keep track of things.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
