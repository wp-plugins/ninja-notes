A Simple Multiple Note System for Wordpress

== Description ==

Do you tend to keep all of your notes on a large collection of bits of paper? Would you rather keep them all easily accessable on your Wordpress site, so they are all there to your fingers? Then Ninja-Notes is for you.

It lets you have as many separate notepads as you want. It's a great way to keep track of things.
