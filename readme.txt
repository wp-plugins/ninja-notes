A Simple Multiple Note System for Wordpress

== Description ==

Do you tend to keep all of your notes on a large collection of bits of paper? Would you rather keep them all easily accessable on your Wordpress site, so they are all there to your fingers? Then Ninja-Notes is for you.

It lets you have as many separate notepads as you want. Or to have fixed notes per Post/Page

It's a great way to keep track of things.

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
